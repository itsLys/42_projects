- The format is composed of zero or more directives:
	-- Ordinary charachters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output
	-- Conversion specifiers, each of which result in fetching zero or more subsqeuent aguments
		* Each conversion specification is introduced by the `%` and ends with a conversion specifier,
		in between, there may be (in this order) zero or more flags, an optional minimum field width,
		an optional precision and an optional length modifier
	-- The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotions) with the conversion specifier.
	-- By  default the argumnets are used in the given order, it is an error if insufficiently
	many arguments are given.
